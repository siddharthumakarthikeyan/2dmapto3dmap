2D Occupancy Map to 3D STL Model for Environment


I had shown how to create a 3D environment from a 2D occupancy grid map for ROS/VREP/MATLAB for autonomous Robot Mapping.

Steps:
1. Import your 2D occupancy grid map (png file) into MATLAB main.m script
2. Run the script
3. Save the output of the MATLAB program as a png file
4. Convert the saved jpeg file to svg file (https://convertio.co/jpg-svg/)
5. Convert the svg file to stl file (https://anyconv.com/svg-to-stl-converter/)

MATLAB Script and Files Used: 

Now you have the 3D environment of the 2D occupancy grid map.
